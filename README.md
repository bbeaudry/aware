## Discussion
Upon first launch, Aware will leverage HealthKitUI to request permissions from the user. Should the user provide access to reading and writing Health data, they may record new sessions and view historical data.

A progress gauge reminds a user of their goals, and shares their progress. Users may monitor their mindfulness trends with a heat map habit grid, and gain useful insights like last and average session durations.

When in session, the user is presented as few UI elements as possible, and the new MeshGradient API provides a subtle, yet immersive animation.
